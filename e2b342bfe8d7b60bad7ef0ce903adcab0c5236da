      "message": "When catching a RefUpdatedEvent it is not possible to distinguish between an event generated from the same node or one coming from a replication.\n\nHow can I only update my metrics when the RefUpdatedEvent is coming from another node?\n\nRefUpdatedEvent doesn\u0027t contain the instanceId...none of the events does.\n\nThe replication.RefReplicatedEvent contains the target node, so I could probably find a way to use it, but the replication-status plugin will have to depend from the replication plugin, isn\u0027t it?\n\nAny idea on how I can fix it?",
